Mini_docusaurus_to_pdf is a CLI tool that generates PDFs from a Docusaurus-based documentation website by scraping the docs pages.

- Writes extracted URLs to `urls_to_check.txt` for transparency and checks/modifications before scrapping.

##  Installation

Clone this repo and install dependencies:


`git clone https://github.com/merryman007/mini_docusaurus_to_pdf.git`

`cd mini_docusaurus_to_pdf`

Then run: `npm install`

##  Usage

1. Modify the `entryPoint` and `baseurl` URL in `scrapper.config.json` to point to your target URL start point or docs root.

2. Run the URL extraction script: `npm run generate-pdf`

This creates a `urls_to_check.txt` file with all URLs found. You can then edit, add or remove urls as required

3. Generate PDFs from the URLs:


After edit, type "`yes`" in the terminal to continue


PDF will be saved in the `output` directory.
